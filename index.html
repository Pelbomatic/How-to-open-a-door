            <ol>
                <h3>First, make sure you have your eyes open and are not blind</h3>
                <h3>If you are blind and inside a room, then you'll be stuck there forever, and there's nothing i can do to help you</h3>
                <h3>Otherwise, look around the room for something tall and rectangular that is in one of the walls, it should also have handle or knob of some kind sticking out of it.</h3>
                <h3>It should look something like this:</h3>
                <img src="./resources/images/door.jpg" width="150" height="400" />
                <h3>Except it will also have a handle or knob which we'll get to next step.</h3>
                <h3>It might also look a bit different than this, but it should be the same general shape at least.</h3>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="findinghandle">
            <h2>Step 2: Locating the handle</h2>
            <h2 class="nopad">Now to actually attempt opening the door, you have to know where the handle is.</h3>
            <h2 class="nopad">Remember, it could also be a knob rather than a handle.</h3>
            <h2 class="nopad">Now, if you made it past the first step, then you have already opened your eyes and are not blind.</h3>
            <h2 class="downpad">So, you will need to:</h2>
            <ol>
                <h3>Make sure you still know where the door is, if you don't then go back to step one.</h3>
                <h3>Then, you will need to make your way to the door to inspect it, you can do this by walking, however if you don't know how to walk, then either crawl or flail towards the door.</h3>
                <h3>Once you have made your way to the door, start inspecting it and look for a handle or knob of some kind, it should be near the middle of the door towards the left or right sides.</h3>
                <h3>I will show you a picture so that you know what to look for.</h3>
                <h3>Door handles look like this:</h3>

                <img src="./resources/images/doorknob.png" width="175" height="150"/>
                <h3>So just look around the door for anything that looks like either of those! Some doors however don't have door handles or door knobs, if that is the case, then, too bad, so sad!</h3>
