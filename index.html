        <h2>Now, onto the steps of opening a door:</h2>
        <div id="findingdoor">
            <h2>Step 1: Finding the door</h2>
            <h3>First, make sure you have your eyes open and are not blind</h3>
            <h3>If you are blind and inside a room, then you'll be stuck there forever, and there's nothing i can do to help you</h3>
            <h3>Otherwise, look around the room for something tall and rectangular that is in one of the walls, it should also have handle or knob of some kind sticking out of it.</h3>
            <h3>It should look something like this:</h3>
            <img src="./resources/images/door.jpg" width="150" height="400" />
            <h3>Except it will also have a handle or knob which we'll get to next step.</h3>
            <h3>It might also look a bit different than this, but it should be the same general shape at least.</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="findinghandle">
            <h2>Step 2: Locating the handle</h2>
            <h2 class="nopad">Now to actually attempt opening the door, you have to know where the handle is.</h3>
            <h2 class="nopad">Remember, it could also be a knob rather than a handle.</h3>
            <h2 class="nopad">Now, if you made it past the first step, then you have already opened your eyes and are not blind.</h3>
            <h2 class="downpad">So, you will need to:</h2>
            <h3>Make sure you still know where the door is, if you don't then go back to step one.</h3>
            <h3>Then, you will need to make your way to the door to inspect it, you can do this by walking, however if you don't know how to walk, then either crawl or flail towards the door.</h3>
            <h3>Once you have made your way to the door, start inspecting it and look for a handle or knob of some kind, it should be near the middle of the door towards the left or right sides.</h3>
            <h3>I will show you a picture so that you know what to look for.</h3>
            <h3>Door handles look like this:</h3>
            <img src="./resources/images/doorhandle.png" width="200" height="100"/>
            <h3>And door knobs look like this:</h3>
            <img src="./resources/images/doorknob.png" width="175" height="150"/>
            <h3>So just look around the door for anything that looks like either of those! Some doors however don't have door handles or door knobs, if that is the case, then, too bad, so sad!</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="arms">
            <h2>Step 3: Making sure you have arms</h2>
            <h2 class="nopad">Now you need to make sure you have a way to turn the door handle/knob.</h2>
            <h2 class="nopad">In this How To, we will use arms to open the door.</h2>
            <h3>First, you need to know what arms are, they are weird lengths of flesh with bones in the middle, they are usually located on each side of your body.</h3>
            <h3>Arms are usually only connected to the top sides of your torso, just below your neck, so look around there for them.</h3>
            <h3>here is a picture of one arm for reference:</h3>
            <img src="./resources/images/arm.jpg" width="300" height="150"/>
        </div>
        <div id="noarms">
            <h2>Step 4: What to do if you don't have arms</h2>
            <h2>If you've looked and you can't seem to find any arms, then all you have to do is:</h2>
            <h3>I don't know, man. You're on your own.</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="movearms">
            <h2>Step 5: How to move your arms</h2>
            <h2>Now that you have found your arms, you'll have to learn how to move them.</h2>
            <h2>So, to move your arms you have to:</h2>
            <h3>Use the muscles in your arms to flail them about.</h3>
            <h3>Just keep tensing and un-tensing your muscles until you can move them fluently.</h3>
            <h3>*WARNING* This may take planck times, yoctoseconds, zeptoseconds, attoseconds, femtoseconds, svedbergs, picoseconds, nanoseconds, shakes, microseconds, milliseconds, centiseconds, deciseconds, seconds, diads, triads, binary minutes, pentads, dodecaseconds, beddons, minutes, millidays, moments, kiloseconds hours, fortminutes, days, sols, weeks, megaseconds, fortnights, twentnights, lunar months, months, quarantines, semesters, lunar years, exclusion years, years, common years, tropical years, gregorion years, sidereal years, mode years, leap years, olympiads, lustrums, decades, indictions, scores, gigaseconds, jubilees, lifetimes, centuries, millenniums, teraseconds, megaannums, peta seconds, galactic years, cosmological decades, aeons, kalpas, earth lifetimes, sun lifetimes, de√øpaksts, univers lifetimes, exaseconds, tera-annums, zettasoconds, peta-annums, yottaseconds, ronnaseconds, quettaseconds, googolseconds, googolyears, zatomatomegaseconds, hyper-units, or even meta-seconds to master.</h3>
            <h3>Many people have never mastered it.</h3>
            <h3>But with enough perseverance...</h3>
            <h3>You too can become a master of your wierd fleshy bone mesh growths.</h3>

            <h2>Step 6: How to turn the door handle</h2>
            <h2>Now that you can move your arms perfectly, you need to grab and turn the door handle/knob.</h2>
            <h2>To do that you need to:</h2>
            <h3>Lift one of your arms up until it is on the same level as the door.</h3>
            <h3>Slowly move it in the direction of the door.</h3>
            <h3>Or in other words, you have to move it, move it, towards the door.</h3>
            <h3>Then you have to grab it.</h3>
